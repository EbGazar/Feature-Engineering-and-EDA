## List of Projects

### ðŸ’¡ Diabets.

##### Project Overview:

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

### ðŸ’¡ AMES Housing Price.

##### Project Overview:

The AMES dataset contains information about houses, the dataset contains 77 features including the size of the house, neighborhood, etc...

### ðŸ’¡ Breast Cancer.

##### Project Overview:

Data Set Information:

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:

Attribute Information:

* `ID number`
* `Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)`

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

* `radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)`
* `texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)`
* `perimeter`
* `area`
* `smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)`
* `compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)`
* `concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)`
* `concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)`
* `symmetry`
* `fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)`
